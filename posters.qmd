title: "Posters"
---

In some venues, the main presentation format is a poster. Posters are a great way to present your work in a visual format, and to have one-on-one conversations with people who are interested in your work.

One common mistake people make while making posters is to try to cram in too much information. Remember that the poster is to supplement you and not to replace you. 

Please see below for two posters that we have made in the past.
