The blog post mainly focuses on displaying a diagram on a webpage using SVG. Examples of applications where we need to display diagrams to show realtime data.
1. Traffic flow
2. Electricity flow
3. Water flow 
4. ....


Today we are going to build an single line diagram to dynamically display the power flow values across a set of loads. 

**Single line diagram:** 
Single line diagram is the representation of a power system using the simple symbol for each component. The single line diagram of a power system is the network which shows the main connections and arrangement of the system components along with their data (such as output rating, voltage, resistance and reactance, etc.).

Download [SVG.js](https://svgjs.com/docs/2.7/) as it will be required for the application.

The application that we will be building will be something that can be useful for your organization to understand the distribution of power flow across the network. The application that we are building will be similar to the picture in the diagram below.

The values displayed will refresh once every 1s. HTML, CSS and JS are necessary prerequsites. So, let's get started. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Bootstrap Example</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
  <script src="svg.js"></script>/*Path to the external svg.js library/*
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container" style="padding:2em;" id="myDiv">
        <svg  class="drawing" id="drawing" width="1000" height="500" >
        </svg>
</div>
</body>
```
The above block contains the starter template bootstrap code. We will be using an external JS library called [svg.js](https://svgjs.com/docs/2.7/). Download it and change add JS reference to it inside head tag. We will now use JS to create the interface which has all the custom shapes. 

**Code has been commented in the code blocks. Start a discussion inside discus form below if you get stuck**


The code block below creates a canvas.
```js
<script>
var x = document.getElementById("drawing").clientWidth;
var y = document.getElementById("drawing").clientHeight;
var draw = SVG("drawing").size(x, y)
</script>
```
Below are the functions that we are going to use. These functions are built over the SVG.js.

```js
<script>
function draw_line(canvas,start_x, start_y,end_x,end_y, width=2) {
    //Draws a line between (start_x,start_y) and (end_x, end_y)
    var line = canvas.line(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y).stroke({ width: width })
}

function draw_rectangle(canvas,center_x,center_y,width,height,color){

    //Draws a rectangle with (center_x,center_y) as the center
    var w_ = width/2;
    var h_ = height/2;
    var polyline = draw.polyline([[center_x-w_,center_y-h_],
                                   [center_x-w_,center_y+h_],
                                   [center_x+w_,center_y+h_],
                                   [center_x+w_,center_y-h_],
                                   [center_x-w_,center_y-h_]])
    polyline.fill(color)
    polyline.stroke({ color: "#f06", width: 4, linecap: "round", linejoin: "round" })

}

function draw_circle(canvas,center_x,center_y,radius,width){
    //Draws a circle with center_x and center_y as the centers
    var circle = canvas.circle(2*radius).center(center_x,center_y)
    circle.fill("white")
    circle.stroke({ color: "blue", width: width, linecap: "round", linejoin: "round" })
}

function draw_text(text,x,y){
    //Puts text at (x,y)
    var text1 = draw.text(text).move(x,y).stroke({width:1})
}
</script>
```

Since, we know what functions are to be used, we just need to play around with numbers(Trying and changing the positions of the boxes) to make the interface. First, lets finish off the horizontal line and vertical lines.

```js
<script>

var x_pos_line1 = x/5// Distance from left side of the canvas for the vertical line
var line_y_coor = y/2// Distance from top of the screen for the horizontal line

draw_line(draw,0, line_y_coor, x, line_y_coor,4)//Horizontal Line
draw_line(draw,x_pos_line1, line_y_coor, x_pos_line1, 0)//Line with Power 75MW
draw_line(draw,x-x_pos_line1, line_y_coor, x-x_pos_line1, 0)//Line with Power 85MW

</script>
```

Now, let's draw the rectangles over them.
```js
<script>

draw_rectangle(draw,x_pos_line1,line_y_coor - 50,30,40,"white");//Drawing a rectangle over the  75MW line
draw_rectangle(draw,x - x_pos_line1,line_y_coor - 50,30,40,"white");//Drawing a rectangle over the  85MW line
draw_rectangle(draw,x/2,line_y_coor,30,40,"white");//Drawing a box over the horizontal line

</script>
```
Now, lets finish off the bottom lines and rectangles. Also, feel free to experiement with the positions of the lines and boxes.

```js
<script >

var x_pos_line2 = x/3

draw_line(draw,x_pos_line2, line_y_coor, x_pos_line2, y - 100)//2000W line
draw_line(draw,x - x_pos_line2, line_y_coor, x - x_pos_line2, y)//1100MW line
draw_line(draw,x-x_pos_line2+50,y - 110, x,y - 110)//Line from the circles

draw_rectangle(draw, x_pos_line2, line_y_coor + 60, 20, 30,"white")
draw_rectangle(draw, x-x_pos_line2, y - 30, 20, 30,"white")//Lower most rectangle

draw_line(draw,x - x_pos_line2 - 20, y, x - x_pos_line2 + 20 ,y)//Bottom Right Horizontal line. Ground Line

</script>
```

Use the below codeblock to draw the  circles.
```js
<script>

draw_circle(draw,x_pos_line2,y - 120 ,20,4)

draw_circle(draw,x-x_pos_line2,y - 120 ,20,4)//Overlapping circles
draw_circle(draw,x-x_pos_line2,y - 100 ,20,4)//Overlapping circles
draw_circle(draw,x-x_pos_line2+30,y - 110 ,20,4)//Overlapping circles

</script>
```

Now, lets put some text over the interface. The readings here display the direction and magnitude of the power. Also, these values change once every 1s. 

```js
<script >

var total = 2000

draw_text("〰〰",x_pos_line2-15,y - 130);
draw_text("▲"+total+" MW",x_pos_line2+10,line_y_coor+10);


var t1 = draw_text("",x_pos_line1+10,30);
var t2 = draw_text("",x - x_pos_line1+10,30);
var t3 = draw_text("",x - x_pos_line2+10,line_y_coor+10);

window.setInterval(function(){
  // t1, t2 and t3 are the text objects
  // In this function, we simply modify the text attribute for each of the readings.

  //Generate random readings
  var reading1 = 100*Math.ceil(Math.random()*10)
  var reading2 = 100*Math.ceil(Math.random()*10)
  var reading3 = total - reading1 - reading2

  // Modify the text objects
  t1.text("▲"+reading1+" MW");
  t2.text("▲"+reading2+" MW");
  t3.text("▼"+reading3+" MW");

}, 1000);//Refresh time in ms

</script>
```

Now, we have  a single line diagram that shows the power consumed by each of the loads in the circuit. You can create more complicated circuits using the method described above. Playing with numbers is all you need to do. Also, check out the original API by SVG.js . This is how the finished interface looks like.
