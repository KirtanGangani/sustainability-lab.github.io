#### Whole Group Meetings
We typically meet once a week for about 45-50 mins. We usually cover a variety of topics, including:
- Short updates from each person on their progress
- Discussion of any issues that have come up
- Presentations on topics/tools of interest to the group
- Paper discussions

We expect students to volunteer to present on topics of interest to them. We also expect students to volunteer to present on papers.

#### Project Meetings
The project meetings are tied to specific projects. We typically start with discussing the last meeting's action items, then discuss any issues that have come up, and then discuss the next steps. The lead student on the project is responsible for setting the agenda and running the meeting. The lead student is also responsible for taking notes and posting them on the project's repository.
